    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make our classic tiramisu recipe. This super-simple Italian dessert actually benefits from being made ahead, allowing all the lovely flavours to mingle</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400ml double cream</li>
        <li>400ml double cream</li>
        <li>75ml marsala</li>
        <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>300ml coffee made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
        <li>175g sponge fingers</li>
        <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
        <li>2tsp cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until you’ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
    <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
    <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
    <li>To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>

</ol>
